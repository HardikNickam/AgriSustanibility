# Enhancing Agri-Sustainability: Multimodal Recommendations for  Demand â€“ Supply Alignment 

This project presents an innovative predictive analytics system for farmers, combining multimodal machine learning techniques. By integrating textual data (like soil composition and market trends) and image data (for soil classification), the system provides tailored crop recommendations. This approach enhances sustainable farming practices and aligns crop selection with market demands, promoting productivity and environmental stewardship in agriculture.










## Problem statement 

Developing a predictive analytics system for crop selection using multimodal machine learning involves key challenges, such as optimizing algorithms for diverse data types and integrating market dynamics for accurate predictions. Ignoring demand-supply dynamics can lead to misaligned crop selections, affecting farmers' profitability and market stability. Addressing these issues is crucial for promoting sustainable farming practices and achieving market equilibrium.

## Objective 
The "Enhancing Agri-Sustainability: Multimodal Recommendations for Demand-Supply Alignment" project aims to transform agriculture by developing an advanced multimodal machine learning model that integrates text and image data for crop prediction. By leveraging historical data, climate information, and user preferences, the project enhances prediction accuracy and assesses soil types for better crop suitability. This approach helps align crop production with market demand, addressing issues of surplus and shortages. Ultimately, the project empowers farmers with tools for informed decision-making, promoting sustainability and balancing demand and supply for a more prosperous agricultural future.

## Demand-Supply Alignment 
Law of Demand-Supply 
- When Supply increases, demand decreases which led to decrease in prices.                   
- When Supply decreases, demand increases which let to increase in prices.
